# chocan-db
CS300 Group 7 chocoholics anonymous database project. :)

- Ethan is responsible for maintaining the _master_ branch.
- Alex handles the _beta_ branch.
- Carl maintains the _alpha_ branch.
- Trent, Long, and Tommy maintain the _develop_ branch.

## NOTE:
### These are the ideals we should strive for when maintaining our respective branches. :)
The _develop_ branch is for new code!
The _alpha_ branch is for unit-tested code.
The _beta_ branch is for system-tested code.
Finally, the _master_ branch should be only used for working code.

# Build instructions:

"make" to recompile with updated files
"make clean" to remove build artifacts
"output" is the file to run after a successful build
